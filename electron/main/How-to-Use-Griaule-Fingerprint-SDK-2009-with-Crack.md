# How to Use Griaule Fingerprint SDK 2009 with Crack
 
Griaule Fingerprint SDK 2009 is a software development kit that allows you to integrate fingerprint recognition in your applications. It supports over 50 types of fingerprint readers and multiple programming languages. It also offers one-to-many fingerprint matching and biometric encryption features. In this article, I will show you how to use Griaule Fingerprint SDK 2009 with crack to create a simple fingerprint authentication application.

## Step 1: Download and Install Griaule Fingerprint SDK 2009 with Crack
 
You can download Griaule Fingerprint SDK 2009 with crack from [this link](https://downloaddevtools.com/en/product/2935/download-bayometric-griaule-fingerprint-sdk). The file size is about 16 MB and it contains the SDK installer and the crack file. After downloading, run the installer and follow the instructions to install the SDK on your computer. You will need to enter a license key during the installation process. You can use any random key or generate one from [this website](https://www.keygenit.net/keygen/Griaule-Fingerprint-Sdk-2009-serial-keygen.html).
 
## Step 2: Copy the Crack File to the SDK Folder
 
After installing the SDK, you need to copy the crack file to the SDK folder. The crack file is named "GrFinger.dll" and it is located in the "Drivers" folder of the downloaded file. The SDK folder is usually located in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Griaule\Fingerprint SDK 2009". Paste the crack file in this folder and replace the original file.
 
## Step 3: Create a New Project and Add References
 
Now you are ready to create a new project using your preferred programming language and IDE. For this example, I will use C# and Visual Studio 2019. To create a new project, open Visual Studio and select "Create a new project". Choose "Windows Forms App (.NET Framework)" as the project type and name it "FingerprintApp". Click "Create" to create the project.
 
Next, you need to add references to the SDK libraries in your project. To do this, right-click on "References" in the Solution Explorer and select "Add Reference". Click on "Browse" and navigate to the SDK folder. Select all the DLL files in this folder and click "OK". You should see them added to your references list.
 
## Step 4: Design the User Interface
 
The next step is to design the user interface of your application. You can use the Toolbox to drag and drop controls onto your form. For this example, I will use a label, a textbox, a button, and a picturebox. Arrange them as shown in the screenshot below:

The label will display a message to the user, the textbox will allow the user to enter their name, the button will initiate the fingerprint capture process, and the picturebox will display the captured fingerprint image.
 
## Step 5: Write the Code
 
The final step is to write the code that will handle the fingerprint recognition logic. You can use any of the supported programming languages, but for this example, I will use C#. Double-click on the button control to generate a click event handler method. In this method, you need to do the following:
 
- Create an instance of GrFingerXCtrl class, which is the main class of the SDK.
- Initialize the SDK using Initialize() method.
- Set up an event handler for OnImageAcquired event, which is triggered when a fingerprint image is captured.
- Set up an event handler for OnEnroll event, which is triggered when a fingerprint template is enrolled.
- Set up an event handler for OnIdentify event, which is triggered when a fingerprint template is identified.
- Call CapStartCapture() method to start capturing fingerprints from any connected reader.

The code for this method should look something like this:
  ```csharp private void button1\_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {     // Create an 0f148eb4a0
