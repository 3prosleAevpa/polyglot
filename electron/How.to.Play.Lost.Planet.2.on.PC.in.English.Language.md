However, some PC users may encounter a problem when trying to play Lost Planet 2 in English language. The game may default to another language, such as Japanese or French, depending on the region of the installation. This can be frustrating for players who want to enjoy the game's story and dialogue in English.
 
Fortunately, there is a simple solution to this issue. In this article, we will show you how to change the language of Lost Planet 2 on PC to English. All you need is a text editor and a few minutes of your time.
 
## Step 1: Locate the Game's Configuration File
 
The first step is to find the game's configuration file, which contains the settings for various aspects of the game, including the language. The file is named `setup.ini` and it is located in the game's installation folder. The default path for the installation folder is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Capcom\Lost Planet 2`, but it may vary depending on your system and preferences.
 
To locate the file, you can either use the Windows search function or navigate to the folder manually. Once you find the file, right-click on it and select `Open with`, then choose a text editor such as Notepad or WordPad.
 
## Step 2: Edit the Language Setting
 
The second step is to edit the language setting in the configuration file. To do this, you need to look for a line that says `Language=`, followed by a number. The number represents the code for the language that the game will use. For example, `Language=0` means Japanese, `Language=1` means English, `Language=2` means French, and so on.
 
To change the language to English, you need to replace the number with `1`. For example, if the line says `Language=0`, you need to change it to `Language=1`. Make sure you do not delete or modify any other part of the file.
 
## Step 3: Save and Run the Game
 
The final step is to save the changes you made to the configuration file and run the game. To save the file, click on `File`, then `Save`, or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+S`. To run the game, double-click on the game's executable file, which is named `LostPlanet2.exe` and located in the same folder as the configuration file.
 
If everything went well, you should be able to play Lost Planet 2 on PC in English language. Enjoy!
